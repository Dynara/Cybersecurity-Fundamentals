# **The CIA Triad: The Core Principles of Information Security**

**The CIA Triad is the foundational model for information security. It represents three core principles that must be upheld to secure information.**

## *Confidentiality:* 
This is about keeping information secret. Think of it as a lock on a diary-only authorized people should be able to read it.
  
  <ins>Encryption:</ins> The process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access.
 
  <ins>Access Control:</ins> Restricting who can view or access data based on their identity and permissions.
 
  <ins>Least Privilege:</ins> Giving users only the minimum access they need to do their job, no more.

## *Integrity:* 
This principle ensures that data is accurate and trustworthy. It's about preventing unauthorized changes.
 
  <ins>Hashing:</ins> A one-way function that creates a unique "fingerprint" for a piece of data. If the data is changed, the fingerprint changes, alerting you to a modification.
 
  <ins>Digital Signatures:</ins> Cryptographic mechanisms that verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document.
 
  <ins>Data Validation:</ins> Checking data as it's entered or processed to ensure it meets certain rules and constraints.

## *Availability:* 
This ensures that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.
 
  <ins> Redundancy:</ins> Having backup systems or data to ensure services can continue if one component fails.
 
  <ins>Disaster Recovery Planning:</ins> A plan for how to recover IT systems and data after a major disruption.
 
  <ins> Backup & Recovery:</ins> Regularly creating copies of data and having a process to restore them.
