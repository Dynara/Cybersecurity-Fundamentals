# **Cryptography** 

Cryptography is the practice of securing communication by encoding it so that only the sender and intended recipient can read it.

## Symmetric Encryption: 
Using the same key for both encryption and decryption.

## AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):
A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.

AES has three initial key sizes: 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit

## Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Cryptography):
Using a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

## RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman): 
A popular asymmetric encryption algorithm.

## Hashing:
As mentioned in the CIA Triad, hashing is a <ins>one-way</ins> function used for data integrity.

Hashes used today:
- MD2
- MD4
- MD5 (problem with hash collisions)
- SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm); this is 160-bit hash value
