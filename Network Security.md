# **Network Security**

This topic covers the measures taken to protect a computer network and its data from unauthorized access or misuse.

## Firewalls: 
Devices or software that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of security rules.

- **<ins>Packet Filtering:</ins>** Checking the source and destination IP addresses and ports of network packets.

- **<ins>Stateful Inspection:</ins>** Tracking the state of network connections to make more intelligent filtering decisions.


## Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): 
Creating a secure, encrypted tunnel over a public network, like the internet, to protect data in transit.

- **<ins>Remote Access VPN:</ins>** Allows a user to securely connect to a corporate network from a remote location.

- **<ins>Site-to-Site VPN:</ins>** Connects two or more separate networks, such as two office locations.

Systems that monitor network traffic for malicious activity or policy violations.

- **<ins>IDS:</ins>** Detects and alerts on suspicious activity.

- **<ins>IPS:</ins>** Detects and automatically takes action to block or prevent the activity.


## Network Segmentation: 
Dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of a breach.
